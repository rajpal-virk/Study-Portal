# Simplification

## Signs Simplification

1. In multiplication and division,

   - when both signs are same, answer always has a positive sign in front of it.
     $$ (+) \times (+) = + $$
    $$ (-) \times (-) = + $$
    $$ \frac {(+)} {(+)} = + $$
    $$ \frac {(-)} {(-)} = + $$

   - when both signs are different, answer always has a negative sign in front of it.
     $$ (+) \times (-) = - $$
    $$ (-) \times (+) = -$$
    $$ \frac {(+)} {(-)} = - $$
    $$ \frac {(-)} {(+)} = - $$

2. In Addition and Subtraction,

   - When signs are same in front of all numbers, we add numbers, and put sign of any number in front of answer.
     $$ 35 + 30 = 65 $$
    $$ -35 -30 = -65 $$

   - When signs are different in front of numbers, we subtract smaller number from greater number, and put the sign of greater number in front of answer.
     example 1
     $$ 30 - 35 = -5 $$
    $$ - 35 + 30 = - 5 $$
    example 2
    $$ 65 - 30 = 35$$

   - When there are more than 2 numbers and some numbers are positive and some numbers are negative, then first group numbers with same signs together and then solve it.
     $$ 25 + 30 - 25 - 35 + 80 -60 $$

     Grouping positive numbers together and negative numbers together
     $$ = 25 + 30 + 80 - 25 -35 -60 $$

     Solving by adding all positive number and separately adding all negative numbers, because signs are same.
     $$ = 135 - 120 $$
     $$ = 15 $$

## BODMAS Rule

    B - Brackets
    O - Of (of means multiply)
    D - Division
    M - Multiplication
    A - Addition
    S - Subtraction

Questions are solved in this sequence from B ..... to ...... S.
