Addition and Subtraction
========================

-  When signs are same in front of all numbers, we add numbers, and put
   sign of any number in front of answer.

   .. math::  35 + 30 = 65 

   .. math::  -35 -30 = -65 

-  When signs are different in front of numbers, we subtract smaller
   number from greater number, and put the sign of greater number in
   front of answer. example 1

   .. math::  30 - 35 = -5 

   .. math::  - 35 + 30 = - 5 

   example 2

   .. math::  65 - 30 = 35

-  When there are more than 2 numbers and some numbers are positive and
   some numbers are negative, then first group numbers with same signs
   together and then solve it.

   .. math::  25 + 30 - 25 - 35 + 80 -60 

   Grouping positive numbers together and negative numbers together

   .. math::  = 25 + 30 + 80 - 25 -35 -60 

   Solving by adding all positive number and separately adding all
   negative numbers, because signs are same.

   .. math::  = 135 - 120 

   .. math::  = 15
