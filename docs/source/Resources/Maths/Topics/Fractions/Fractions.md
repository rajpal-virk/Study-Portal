# Fractions

## General Terms

$$\frac {4}{5}$$
$$\frac {numerator} {denominator} $$

4 over 5

4 is divided by 5

Four-fifth

## Fraction Types

3-types

### 1. Proper Fraction

- Numerator is smaller than Denominator.
  $$ \frac {4}{5} $$

### 2. Improper Fraction

- Numerator is greater than Denominator.
  $$ \frac {5}{4} $$

### 3. Mixed Fraction

- has 2 parts - a whole number and a fraction
  $$ 3 \frac {4} {5}$$
  (To solve numerator, 3 \* 5 + 4 = 19 and denominator stays same.)
- simplified form of mixed fraction is improper fraction
  $$ \frac {19}{5} $$

## Fraction Comparison (which fraction is greater)

3-cases

### Denominators are same

- Ignore denominators and check which number has greater numerator.
- Number with greater numerator forms fraction that is greater than the other fraction.
  $$\frac {4}{5} or \frac{8}{5}$$
- In above example, denominators 5 is same in both fractions. Comparing numerators 4 and 8, we can see 8 > 4.
- Therefore
  $$ \frac{4}{5} < \frac{8}{5}$$

### Denominators are different, but Numerators are same

- Ignore numerators and check which number has smaller denominator.
- Number with smaller denominator forms fraction that is greater than the other fraction.
  $$ \frac{4}{7} or \frac{4}{10}$$
- In above example, numerator 4 is same in both fractions. Comparing denominators 7 and 10, we can see 7 < 10.
- Therefore
  $$ \frac{4}{7} > \frac{4}{10}$$
  In other words, if 4 items are to be divided among 7 people, 7 people will have more portion of items when compared to dividing 4 items among 10 people.

### Both Denominators and Numerators are different

steps:

1. Find L.C.M. (least common multiple) of denominators
2. Find the multiple of each denominator that is equal to L.C.M.
3. Multiply each numerator with respective multiple found using its denominator in step 2.
4. Compare the new numerators.
5. Numerator with grater value forms fraction that is greater than the other fraction.

$$\frac {4}{7} or \frac{5}{9}$$
L.c.M.of 7 and 9 is 63.
$$\frac{(4 \times ?) or (5 \times ?)}{63}$$
for $\frac {4}{7}$, 9 is the multiple of 7 that equals to 63.
for $\frac {5}{9}$, 7 is the multiple of 9 that equals to 63.
$$\frac{(4 \times 9) or (5 \times 7)}{63}$$
$$\frac{(36) or (35)}{63}$$
since 36 > 35,
$$\frac {4}{7} > \frac{5}{9} $$

## Additing and Subtracting Fractions

Use the same method as shown in case 3 of Fraction Comparison (when both Denominators and Numerators are different).

### Addition Example

$$\frac {4}{7} + \frac{5}{9}$$
L.c.M.of 7 and 9 is 63.
$$\frac{(4 \times ?) + (5 \times ?)}{63}$$
for $\frac {4}{7}$, 9 is the multiple of 7 that equals to 63.
for $\frac {5}{9}$, 7 is the multiple of 9 that equals to 63.
$$\frac{(4 \times 9) + (5 \times 7)}{63}$$
$$\frac{(36) + (35)}{63}$$
since 36 + 35 = 71
$$\frac{71}{63}$$

### Subtraction Example

$$\frac {4}{7} - \frac{5}{9}$$
L.c.M.of 7 and 9 is 63.
$$\frac{(4 \times ?) - (5 \times ?)}{63}$$
for $\frac {4}{7}$, 9 is the multiple of 7 that equals to 63.
for $\frac {5}{9}$, 7 is the multiple of 9 that equals to 63.
$$\frac{(4 \times 9) - (5 \times 7)}{63}$$
$$\frac{(36) - (35)}{63}$$
since 36 - 35 = 1
$$\frac{1}{63}$$

## Multiplying Fractions

- For 2 or more fractions, Multiply numerators with numerators and denominators with denominators.
  $$\frac {4}{7} \times \frac{5}{9}$$
  $$\frac{4 \times 5} {7 \times 9}$$
  $$\frac{20}{63}$$

## Dividing Fractions

- Solve 2 fractions at a time.
- Take second fraction, and flip numerator to denominator and denominator to numerator.
- After flipping numerator and denominator, change the division sign to Multiplication sign.
- Now simply solve multiplication.

$$\frac {4}{7} \div \frac{9}{5}$$

- Flip second fraction, $\frac{9}{5}$ to $\frac{5}{9}$, and change its division sign to multiplication.

$$\frac {4}{7} \times \frac{5}{9}$$
$$\frac{4 \times 5} {7 \times 9}$$
$$\frac{20}{63}$$
